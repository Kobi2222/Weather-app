# **Weather App**
A weather application built with Ruby on Rails that fetches weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. This application allows users to check the weather based on their location and provides an easy-to-use interface for viewing weather information.

# **Ruby Version**
This project is built using Ruby 3.1.2.

bash
Copy code
ruby -v

# **System Dependencies**
Ensure the following dependencies are installed:

Ruby 3.1.2
Rails 6.x.x
PostgreSQL 12.x or higher (or another compatible database)
Node.js (for managing JavaScript dependencies)
Yarn (for JavaScript and asset management)
Mailcatcher (for handling email during development)
To install these dependencies, follow the instructions specific to your operating system.

Installing System Dependencies on macOS/Linux
Install Homebrew (if not installed):

bash
Copy code
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
Install Ruby:

bash
Copy code
brew install ruby
Install PostgreSQL:

bash
Copy code
brew install postgresql
Install Node.js:

bash
Copy code
brew install node
Install Yarn:

bash
Copy code
brew install yarn
Install Bundler:

bash
Copy code
gem install bundler
# **Configuration**
Before running the application, you need to configure the following:

Obtain OpenWeatherMap API Key:

Sign up on OpenWeatherMap to get your API key.
Configure the API Key:

Add your OpenWeatherMap API key to the .env file or Rails credentials.
Example for .env:
bash
Copy code
OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
Mailcatcher Configuration:

To capture and view sent emails locally in development, use Mailcatcher.
Run the following command to start Mailcatcher:
bash
Copy code
mailcatcher
Visit http://127.0.0.1:1080 to view captured emails.
# **Database Creation**
This application uses PostgreSQL. Ensure PostgreSQL is installed before proceeding. Then follow these steps:

Create the Database:

bash
Copy code
rails db:create
Run Migrations:

bash
Copy code
rails db:migrate
# **Database Initialization**
To seed your database with initial data, such as default cities or settings:

bash
Copy code
rails db:seed
# **How to Run the Test Suite**
To ensure everything is working correctly, you can run the test suite. This will execute unit tests, model validations, and more:

bash
Copy code
rails test
You can also run specific tests using RSpec if you're using it for your testing framework.



# **To Start the Server**
To run the server locally, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
rails s
By default, the server will run on http://localhost:3000.

# **Mailcatcher**
To catch and view email messages in the development environment, you can use Mailcatcher. It provides a web interface to see the emails sent by the application.

Run the following command to start Mailcatcher:

bash
Copy code
mailcatcher
Access the email interface at:

Services (Job Queues, Cache Servers, Search Engines, etc.)
Background Jobs
If you're using background job processing (e.g., with Sidekiq) to handle tasks like fetching weather data, follow these steps to set it up:

Install the required gem:

ruby
Copy code
gem 'sidekiq'
Install the gem:

bash
Copy code
bundle install
Run Sidekiq:

bash
Copy code
bundle exec sidekiq
Caching
Configure caching to optimize performance, especially when dealing with external APIs like OpenWeatherMap.

To use Memcached or Redis for caching, set up a caching store in config/environments/production.rb:
ruby
Copy code
config.cache_store = :mem_cache_store
Deployment Instructions
To deploy the app to Heroku or any other cloud platform, follow these steps:

Deploying to Heroku
Install the Heroku CLI if you don’t already have it.
Log in to Heroku:
bash
Copy code
heroku login
Create a new Heroku app:
bash
Copy code
heroku create
Push your code to Heroku:
bash
Copy code
git push heroku master
Run database migrations:
bash
Copy code
heroku run rails db:migrate
Your application will be deployed and accessible via the URL provided by Heroku.

To Start the Server
To run the server locally, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
rails s
By default, the server will run on http://localhost:3000.

Mailcatcher
To catch and view email messages in the development environment, you can use Mailcatcher. It provides a web interface to see the emails sent by the application.

Run the following command to start Mailcatcher:

bash
Copy code
mailcatcher
